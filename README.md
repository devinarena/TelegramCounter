# TelegramCounter
## About
Counts the number of telegram messages per and year using BeautifulSoup webscraper and displays them using matplotlib.  
This program was written in around 6 hours just for my pure curiosity of text messaging trends between me and my girlfriend.
## Usage
Export your telegram messages using the desktop app, this should create a whole bunch of html files.  
Run the python file in your command prompt or terminal and enter the directory of the exported html documents.  
The program will scrape every html file and count the number of messages per month and year then will display them using tkinter and matplotlib.  
You can save an image of the plot using the button on the bottom left.
